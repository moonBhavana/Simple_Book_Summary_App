    <h1>While Flocks Last</h1>
    <p>Armed with a field guide and a half-decent pair of binoculars,<br> Charlie Elder travels the length and breadth of the British<br> Isles to spot forty bird species in serious decline - the UK's Red List.<br> He looks at why their numbers have fallen, what efforts are<br> being made to encourage their recoveries and meets experts and enthusiasts<br> who are working to make a difference.<br>
    He also examines just why birds matter in the first place and<br> considers the role of the birdwatcher - one species that is certainly not in decline.<br></p>
